As a Ph.D. student, we all need to build or website to show our research and to introduce ourselves to the world. This post is my note on how to use Hugo, a static website generator, to build your own website and host it on GitHub.

## GitHub part
First of all, you need to sign up an account on GitHub. [Details](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) is on official website.

After signed up, you can press the icon on the top-right cornor and enter your profile.

Then create two new repository: `website` (or any name that store your raw content of your website) and `<username>.github.io` (the actuall repository to host your website).
If you use other name for the repository to host your website, the website url would be `https://github.com/<username>/<repository_name>/`.

Use `git clone` to copy both repository to your local directories. I suggest it to be in two distinct directories. The url for repository can be found at the green buttom `Clone or download`. The code would be:

```bash
git clone <resitory_url>
```

## Local file part

Now you need to install `hugo` and `git` to generate your static website and upload your website to github, respectively.

You can refer to [the officien webste of hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to know how to install both of them on your OS. If you use Arch, then you can install them by

```terminal
sudo pacman -S hugo git
```

Enter or `cd` to your `website` directory, and generate your new website by

```bash
hugo new site [new-site-name]
```

There will be a new directory in your `website` directory. Move all the content in the new directory to your `website`, and delete the new directory. The structure of the `website` directory will be

```bash
website
├── archetypes
│   └── default.md
├── config.toml
├── content
├── data
├── layouts
├── static
└── themes

6 directories, 2 files
```

Congratulation! You already built the skeleton of website!

### Explanation on directory tree

The `default.md` in `archetypes` directory is the default format that generated by hugo.

`config.toml` is the configuration for the whole website. Should cooperate with `themes`

`themes` contains all the themes you downloaded. You can download themes from github using `git clone`.

You put all your posts in `content`.

### Hugo command

`hugo new <directory>/<posts>` will create a new markdown file `posts` inside `./content/<directory>/`. For example, `hugo new post/HugoNote.md` will create a new posts called `HugoNote.md` inside `./content/post/`. If you want to post in `content` directory, you can use `hugo new content/<posts>`.

`hugo server` generates your website at `http://localhost:1313/`.

`hugo -d <directory>` outputs all the html and css files to the directory.


## Host website on GitHub

Now we are going to transform your markdown content into html and css and host on github.

1. Use `hugo -d ../<username>.github.io/` to output your website.
2. Move to `<username>.github.io/` or `cd ../<username>.github.io/`.
3. In the `<username>.github.io/`, type `git status` to check the difference between local file and remote github file.
4. `git add --all` or `git add .` to add all difference into commit.
5. `git commit -m "<message>"` to commit all the difference with comment message.
6. `git push origin master` to push all the difference to remote github file.
7. Open browser and go to your `<username>.github.io` repository, go to `setting` and in the "GitHub Pages" section, choose "source" as `master branch`. Wait for a couple of minutes, and your website is established!

## Include image in your blog

There are two ways to insert images into your posts:

1. The hugo-primer theme's default image path is `./static/images/*`, i.e., every file in the `./static/images/` directory, so

	-  Make a new directory called `images` in the static directory, i.e., `mkdir ./static/images`
	-  Put all your images in the `images` directory.
	-  Or, you can make a new directory based on your posts. For example, for this posts, I put all the images in the `./static/images/HugoNote/*`.

2. Put image in your blog directory or any directory inside blog directory
	- Use `![text to display](/blog/imagename)` when you put images in your blog directory.
	- Use `![text to display](/blog/nameofdirectory/imagename)` when you put images in the new directory inside your blog directory.


## Include pdf in your blog

### Include pdf link in your blog

- Put your pdf files in either static directory, or just build a new directory that contains your markdown file and pdf file
- Use `[text to display](path/to/your/pdffile)` to add a link to your pdf file.
	- For example, since static is the default path for files, if you put your pdf file in static directory, you can use `[text to display](/nameofpdf.pdf)` as the path.
	- If you build a new directory, your path would be `[text to display](/blog/nameofdirectory/nameofpdf.pdf)`.

### Embed pdf in your blog

If you put the pdf file in the `/content/blog/` directory, then the corresponding url for it would be `yourwebsite.github.io/blog/nameofpdf.pdf`.

For example, if I put a file called `HugoNote.pdf` in the `/content/blog/` directory, then my url would be `https://huijunchen9260.github.io/blog/HugoNote.pdf`.

After figuring out the url of pdf file, we can use google drive pdf viewer to embed the pdf file. Use the url example above, the html code would be

```html
<embed src="https://drive.google.com/viewerng/
viewer?embedded=true&url=https://huijunchen9260.github.io/blog/HugoNote.pdf" width="100%" height="800px">
```

Description of code:
- `src` is the source of display. we use google drive viewer to show pdf file inside the webpage.
- `url` is the url based on the website.
- `width` and `height` can set using absolute measure (e.g. 500px) or relative measure (e.g. percentage of the webpage.
