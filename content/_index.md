## About me

Hi! My name is Hui-Jun Chen(陳惠鈞). I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at The Ohio State University. My research mainly focuses on industrial organization. Before I arrived in the United States, I received my undergraduate and Master's degrees in Economics at National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan (R.O.C.).

My master thesis is about how multi-product firms allocate their R\&D resources under Cournot competition. At The Ohio State University, I intend to use my experience in theoretical industrial organization as a foundation to explore the world of empirical industrial organization through an academic lens.


## Hobby / Tech

A small hobby of mine is to "rice" (customize) my Arch Linux. Arch Linux is a rolling release Linux distro, with a huge community and an outstanding [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/). I use [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) as my tiling windows manager, and [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) as my status bar. You can find my dotfiles in my github repository.

The programming language I mainly use is shell scripting. I try my best to write my scripts in POSIX compliant shell. I am currently learning Matlab in my Macroeconomics courses and python and R in my spare time.
